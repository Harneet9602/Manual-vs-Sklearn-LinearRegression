# Manual vs Sklearn Linear Regression

This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** using:

- Manual Gradient Descent from scratch
- scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression` model

The aim is to:
- Understand how Gradient Descent optimizes weights
- Compare manually obtained results with library-based implementations
- Visualize the regression line and evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---
